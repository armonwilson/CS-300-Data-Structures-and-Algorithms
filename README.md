# CS-300-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

The projects in this course centered on efficient data management. Project One involved analyzing the run-time and memory use of different data structures (vectors, hash tables, and trees) in the context of managing bids for a fictional company. This helped me understand the trade-offs involved in choosing one structure over another. Project Two focused on sorting and printing course information, highlighting the importance of selecting the right sorting algorithm for specific data.

My approach to both projects began with understanding the data structures. These structures are fundamental to how information is stored and accessed in a program, and the choice of structure greatly impacts efficiency. In Project One, I analyzed the bid management system's operations to determine the most suitable data structures for each task. In Project Two, I opted for a stable sorting algorithm to preserve the order of courses with the same prefix.

I faced challenges related to debugging and optimization. In Project One, careful attention was needed to ensure proper memory management and handle edge cases within the data structures. In Project Two, I experimented with different algorithms to find the most efficient one for the given data.

These projects deepened my understanding of software design. I now appreciate the importance of choosing the right data structures and algorithms early on, as this significantly impacts a program's maintainability, readability, and adaptability. I've also learned to prioritize modularity and encapsulation in my code, making it easier to manage.

Moreover, these projects have refined my coding style. I now emphasize writing clean, well-documented code that adheres to industry standards. This makes my code easier to understand for both myself and others, and it facilitates collaboration and future enhancements. I'm also more conscious of writing adaptable code that can accommodate changing requirements.

Overall, CS 300 has been a transformative experience. It has equipped me with valuable skills in data structures and algorithms, making me a more confident and effective programmer. This newfound expertise will undoubtedly benefit me in my future career as a software developer.
